# 🧠 Retail Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning
### CodeClause Internship Project

## 📋 Overview
This project predicts future **retail sales** using **machine learning and time series analysis**.  
By analyzing past sales patterns, trends, and seasonality, it helps businesses plan inventory, optimize supply chains, and forecast demand accurately.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean, preprocess, and visualize retail sales data.
- Apply machine learning models for forecasting.
- Compare model performance and improve accuracy.
- Provide actionable insights for retail decision-making.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools
- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Statsmodels

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Import retail sales dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, normalize, and prepare data.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify patterns and correlations.  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create lag, date, or category-based features.  
5. **Model Building** – Train regression or time series models.  
6. **Forecasting** – Predict upcoming sales values.  
7. **Evaluation** – Assess model accuracy using RMSE, MAE, etc.
